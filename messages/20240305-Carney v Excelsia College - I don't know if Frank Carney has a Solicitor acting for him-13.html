<div class="moz-text-flowed">Dear Alex,
<br>
<br>In the matter of Carney v Excelsia College, I do not know if Frank 
Carney has a Solicitor acting for him. In the event that he does not, 
Frank Carney is the contact point in respect of this litigation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Yours sincerely,
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>I am not sure if Mr Carney has a solicitor acting for him or whether I
<br>could speak with you?
<br>
<br>Would you have some time next week to discuss the matter?
<br>
<br>I look forward to hearing from you.
